Sometimes you just need to connect some wires and dig into a project. Quick connector boards get you working right away.

KF141 is a popular quick connector block with sturdy spring retention clamps. Press the lever, insert a stripped wire, then release the lever to clamp it firmly in place. Pin names are silkscreened in bright orange so you get the right connection the first time. Made with the [highest quality KF141 we could source](https://forum.buspirate.com/t/kf141-quick-connector-adapter/90/4?u=ian).
