### Dyed plastic button caps

![Small plastic button caps, dyed red, blue, yellow](/images/docs/enclosure/caps-color-512.jpg) 

We sent white button caps [to an ABS plastic dying factory](https://forum.buspirate.com/t/dyed-abs-button-caps/119). The dye master color-matched the caps to red, yellow and blue "retro" arcade button samples.

ABS plastic can be dyed. The supplier is a factory that specializes in dying plastic clothing buttons and beads. First they do a material test with a random color. If everything looks good, they quote a price per gram of plastic dyed. We also used this technique to [color code the AUX cable](/cables) shrouded headers.

### Hydrographic foil dip dyed caps

Hydrographic foil dip dying is a technique that coats plastic objects with a thin printed graphic film. There's a huge selection ready-made foils, and many suppliers can even print custom designs. This batch of caps was dip dyed with the smallest/tightest carbon fiber design available.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
The supplier hydro dips all kinds of stuff, but button caps are unusually small. Car/motorcycle parts and helmets are common.
