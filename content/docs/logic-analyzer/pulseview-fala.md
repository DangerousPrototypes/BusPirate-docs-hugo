# PulseView with Follow Along Interface

![](./img/fala1.png)

FALA is a "live action" logic analyzer mode that automatically captures everything that happens when you send commands from the Bus Pirate. It eliminates the need to setup triggers and arm a second tool for debugging.  We like to call it FALA for short.

- [PulseView with FALA mode](https://github.com/DangerousPrototypes/BusPirate5-firmware/releases/tag/custom) (Windows)

Currently FALA support is only available in a special patched version of PulseView for Windows.

{{% alert context="danger" %}}
All Bus Pirate hardware supports follow along logic analyzer, however only Bus Pirate 6 has a second buffer to capture pins directly. In earlier hardware **all output pins are measured behind the IO buffer**. This means the logic capture may not match the actual output of the IO buffer. **This is not a problem when the Bus Pirate is used as a logic analyzer only and all pins are inputs**.

## Capabilities

- 62.5MSPS (or more if overclocked)
- 131K samples
- 8 channels
- Trigger: single pin, high or low
- Follow along logic analyzer mode
- Base pin can be set to an internal pin for debugging the Bus Pirate itself

## Enable FALA Interface

Enable the FALA binary interface with the ```binmode``` command. This will configure the logic analyzer and send capture notifications to the Bus Pirate's second serial port.
- Type ```binmode``` in the terminal
- Select "Follow along lgic analyzer"


## Configure PulseView

![](./img/fala2.png)

Click "connect to device" and configure PulseView for the Bus Pirate FALA mode.

- Select the ```BP5 + binmode-FALA``` driver
- Select ```serial port``` and choose the Bus Pirate serial port that is **not** used for the terminal (lower number for me these days)
- Click ```Scan for devices```
- Hopefully the Bus Pirate is detected. Click OK.

### Run Capture on PulseView

Click "run" to start capturing.

Enter a Bus Pirate mode. For now, SPI is best for testing.
- ```m``` to enter a mode, I suggest SPI

### Auto Capture Speed

<span style="color:#bfa530">Actual speed:</span> 10kHz
<span style="color:#bfa530">Logic analyzer speed:</span> 80000Hz (8x oversampling)

When changing protocol modes with the ```m``` command, FALA will automatically set the capture speed to oversample the bus speed by a factor of 8.

Every time you send data to the bus, the logic analyzer will capture samples. Enable the power supply and write some data.
- ```W 5``` to enable a 5volt power supply
- ```[0x00 0xff 0x55 0xaa]``` write some data to the bus
- ```Logic analyzer: 288 samples captured``` indicates how many samples were captured by the logic analyzer

### Live Logic View!

![](./img/fala4.png)

The samples are loaded into PulseView every time something happens on the bus.
- You may need to zoom a lot if there are only a few samples
- The box with a 2 (red arrow) indicates the number of captures. Up and down arrows scroll through the capture history

![](./img/fala5.png)

Autozoom fits all samples in the logic graph (red arrow).

## Change Capture Speed
{{% term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" %}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">SPI></span> logic -o 16
Oversample rate set to: 16

Logic Analyzer settings
 Oversample rate: 16
 Sample frequency: 10000Hz

Note: oversample rate is not 1
Actual sample frequency: 160000Hz (16 * 10000Hz)

<span style="color:#96cb59">SPI></span> 
{{% /term %}}

The base capture speed or the oversample rate can can be changed with the ```logic``` command. Changing the oversample rate with the ```-o``` flag is probably easiest as the Bus Pirate will calculate the new sample frequency for you.

## Limitations

This is Windows only for now. The FALA mode is not supported in the official PulseView release.

Only a few modes have been updated to work with FALA. Some modes have internal buffers that cause the logic capture to end early or even return no samples. Each mode needs a new function to indicate when all bus activity is done. 

All Bus Pirate hardware supports the follow along logic analyzer, however only Bus Pirate 6 has a second buffer for the follow along mode. In earlier hardware **all output pins are measured behind the IO buffer**. This means the logic capture may not match the actual output of the IO buffer. **This is not a problem when the Bus Pirate is used as a logic analyzer only and all pins are inputs**.

## Logic Analyzer System

![](./img/logic-system.png)

{{% alert context="info" %}}
The ```logic``` command and the [follow along binmode interface](/logic-analyzer/pulseview-fala) can be run at the same time. However, the capture buffer is shared with [SUMP logic analyzer mode](/logic-analyzer/pulseview-sump). SUMP and follow along logic analyzer modes cannot be used at the same time and will result in a memory error warning.
