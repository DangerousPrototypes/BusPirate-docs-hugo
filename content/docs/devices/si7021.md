## Setup

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-setup.html" >}}

SI7021 is an I2C device, so we need to set the Bus Pirate to I2C mode.

- ```m i2c``` - set the Bus Pirate to I2C [mode]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#m-set-bus-mode" >}}), or just hit ```m``` to select from the menu.
- ```400``` - set the I2C bus speed to 400kHz.
- ```1``` - disable clock stretching.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
The SI7021 supports clock stretching, which is a way for the device to signal that it needs more time to process a command. It adds some complexity though, so we've disabled it for this demo.

### Power supply
![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-power.png)

According to the datasheet, the SI7021 requires a 1.9-3.6 volt power supply. 

Image source: [datasheet](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/120BBE4C/63500094/Sensirion_Datasheet_Humidity_Sensor_SHT21.pdf).

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-power.html" >}}

Letâ€™s set the Bus Pirate to power the chip at 3.3volts, a very common voltage for modern I2C devices.
- ```W 3.3``` - enable the [onboard power supply]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#ww-power-supply-offon">}}) at 3.3volts.

### Pull-up resistors

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-pullup.html" >}}

I2C is an open collector output bus, the Bus Pirate and the SI7021 can only pull the line low to 0 (ground). A pull-up resistor is needed to pull the line high to 1 (3.3 volts). The Bus Pirate has built-in pull-up resistors that can be enabled with the ```P``` command.
- ```P``` - Enable the [onboard pull-up resistors]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors">}}).

{{% alert context="warning" %}} 
Be sure to enable the pull-up resistors. The data line will never go high without them and you'll read only 0s.
{{% /alert %}}

## I2C address scan

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-scan.html" >}}

We need the correct I2C address to talk to the sensor. We could look in the datasheet, or we can run the handy [I2C address scanner]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#scan-i2c-address-search">}}).
- ```scan``` - Scan the I2C bus for devices

The scanner found an I2C device at address 0x40 (0x80 write, 0x81 read).

{{% alert context="info" %}} 
If the scanner doesn't find the device, ensure the power supply is enabled ```W 5``` and the pull-up resistors are enabled ```P```. Also check that slide switches SW1 and SW2 select VOUT and GND respectively.
{{% /alert %}}

## Commands

![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-commands.png)

The SI7021 has a number of commands that can be sent over the I2C bus. In this demo we'll use the following commands:
- ```0xf5``` - Measure humidity, no hold master
- ```0xf3``` - Measure temperature, no hold master
- ```0xe0``` - Read temperature from previous humidity measurement
- ```0xe6``` - Write user (configuration) register 1
- ```0xe7``` - Read user (configuration) register 1

## Measurement resolution

![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-sense-time.png)

Accurate temperature and humidity measurements take longer than low resolution measurements. The table shows that an 8-bit humidity measurement completes in 3.1ms, while a 12-bit resolution measurement takes four times longer (12ms).

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
Each humidity measurement **also triggers a temperature measurement** which is used for compensation. The **total** measurement time is humidity (12ms @ 12-bits) + temperature (10.8ms @ 14-bits) = 22.8ms (~23ms).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert context="info" %}}
If you want the highest resolution and you have the time to spare, SI7021 can do that! In a hurry and don't need the absolute best accuracy? SI7021 can do that too! The next steps configure the measurement resolution.
{{% /alert %}}

### User register 1

![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-userreg.png)

*User register 1* is a strange name for the SI7021 configuration register. The settings in this register control the measurement resolution and heater. 
- Bit 7 and bit 0 of the user register set the measurement resolution. 
- Bit 6 shows the power status. 
- Bit 2 controls a heater in the sensor. The heater is used to test the sensor, dry condensation or take dew-point measurements.
- The other bits are reserved (RSVD) and should not be changed from the default values.

### Read user register 1
![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-read-reg.png)

Reading user register 1 is a two step process. First write the *read register command* to the SI7021 write address, then read the result from the read address.
1. **S** - Begin with an I2C START bit
2. **SA + W** - Send the SI7021 write address (0x80)
3. **Read Reg Cmd** - Send the read user register command (0xe7)
4. **Sr** - Send an I2C repeated START bit
5. **SA + R** - Send the SI7021 read address (0x81)
6. **Read Data** - Read one byte of data from the user register
7. **P** - End with an I2C STOP bit

{{% alert context="info" %}}
**A** and **NA** in the datasheet diagram above refer to acknowledge and not acknowledge bits. The Bus Pirate automatically sends an ACK after each byte, except the last byte which is NACKed.
{{% /alert %}}
 
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-read-config.html" >}}

SI7021 should default to 12-bit humidity and 14-bit temperature measurement after power up. Let's read the configuration from user register 1 to be sure.

- ```[``` - [I2C START bit]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#bus-commands-4" >}})
- ```0x80``` - SI7021 write address
- ```0xe7``` - Read user register command
- ```[``` - I2C repeated START bit
- ```0x81``` - SI7021 read address
- ```r``` - [Read]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#r-read-byte">}}) one byte
- ```]``` - I2C STOP bit 

User register 1 returns 0x3A. Let's convert the register value to binary so it's a bit easier to read.

### Decode user register 1
{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-config-convert.html" >}} 

The [```=``` convert command]({{% relref "/docs/command-reference/#x-convert-to-hexdecbin-number-format" %}}) displays a value in HEX, decimal, binary and ASCII formats. The SI7021 user register 1 value 0x3A converts to 0b00111010 in binary.

![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-mres.png)

>0b```0```011101```0``` 

Looking at the user register layout again, bits 7 and 0 select the measurement resolution. Bit 7 and 0 are both 0, which means the SI7021 is set to 12-bit resolution for humidity and 14-bit resolution for temperature.

### Write user register 1

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
This demo uses the default 12-bit humidity and 14-bit temperature resolution, so **there is no need to change the configuration**. Let's look at how to change it if you'd like to use a different resolution or the setting is incorrect.
{{% /alert %}}

![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-write-reg.png)

Writing *user register 1* is over I2C is similar to reading it. 
1. **S** - Begin with an I2C START bit
2. **SA + W** - Send the SI7021 write address (0x80)
3. **Write Reg Cmd** - Send the write user register command (0xe6)
4. **Data** - Send the new user register value (0x3A for 12-bit humidity and 14-bit temperature)
5. **P** - End with an I2C STOP bit

It is **important** to only change the bits that control the measurement resolution (bits 7 and 0). **The reserved bit should not be changed from the default values**.

- 0b```0```011101```0``` - bit 7 and 0 are ```00```, 12bit RH, 14bit Temp
- 0b```0```011101```1``` - bit 7 and 0 are ```01```, 8bit RH, 12bit Temp
- 0b```1```011101```0``` - bit 7 and 0 are ```10```, 10bit RH, 13bit Temp
- 0b```1```011101```1``` - bit 7 and 0 are ```11```, 11bit RH, 11bit Temp

These are the register values for each of the four measurement options, **with the reserved bits set to the default values**. 

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-write-config.html" >}}

Let's configure user register 1 for 12-bit humidity and 14-bit temperature measurements.
- ```[``` - I2C START bit
- ```0x80``` - SI7021 write address
- ```0xe6``` - Write user register command
- ```0b00111010``` - Write the user register value (0x3A) for 12-bit humidity and 14-bit temperature
- ```]``` - I2C STOP bit

Go back and [read the user register]({{< relref "/docs/devices/si7021/#read-user-register-1" >}}) again to confirm the value was written correctly if you'd like, or keep going to finally actually measure temperature and humidity!

## Measure humidity

SI7021 has two types of measurement commands. 
- **I2C clock stretching** pauses the master (Bus Pirate) by holding the clock line low until the measurement is complete. 
- **No Hold Master Mode** commands, on the other hand, cause the SI7021 to ignore its I2C read address until the measurement is complete.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Clock stretching is useful, but it ties up the I2C bus while the measurement is in progress and no other sensors can be read until it completes. Let's use the **no hold master commands** with a delay instead.
{{% /alert %}}

![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-measure.png)

Triggering a humidity measurement follows the typical I2C transaction pattern: write the command to the write address, then read the result from the read address. The only trick is that we need to add the [correct delay]({{< relref "/docs/devices/si7021/#measurement-resolution">}}) before reading the result. If we try to read before the measurement is complete, the SI7021 will not acknowledge (NACK) the read address.
1. **S** - Begin with an I2C START bit
2. **SA + W** - Send the SI7021 write address (0x80)
3. **Measure Humidity Cmd** - Send the measure humidity command, no hold measurement mode (0xf5)
4. **Sr** - Send an I2C repeated START bit (or we could send a STOP bit and a new START bit before reading)
5. **SA+R, NA** - The SI7021 will not ACK its read address until the measurement is complete, so we need to wait a bit before reading the result.  
5. **SA + R** - Send the SI7021 read address (0x81)
6. **MS/LS bytes** - Read the two byte humidity measurement, and an optional checksum byte.
7. **P** - End with an I2C STOP bit

{{< /term >}}

We're going to deviate from the datasheet example a bit here. Instead of repeating the read address until the measurement is complete, we'll end the write command with an I2C STOP bit, then wait for a fixed delay of 23ms before reading the result.

- ```[``` - I2C START bit
- ```0x80``` - SI7021 write address
- ```0xf5``` - Measure humidity command, no hold master mode
- ```]``` - I2C STOP bit, ends this transaction
- ```D:23``` - [Delay]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#dd-delay-1usms">}}) for 23ms to allow the measurement to complete
- ```[``` - I2C START bit, begins the read transaction
- ```0x81``` - SI7021 read address
- ```r:2``` - Read two bytes of data (the humidity measurement)
- ```]``` - I2C STOP bit, ends the read transaction

The two byte humidity measurement is 0xaa and 0x02. The first byte is the most significant byte (MSB) and the second byte is the least significant byte (LSB).

{{% alert context="info" %}}
23ms is the [maximum time]({{< relref "/docs/devices/si7021/#measurement-resolution">}}) it takes to complete a 12-bit humidity (12ms) and 14-bit temperature (10.8ms) measurement.

### Convert to humidity

{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> = 0xaa02
 =0x<span style="color:#53a6e6">AA</span>02.16 =43522.16 =0b<span style="color:#53a6e6">1010</span>1010<span style="color:#53a6e6">0000</span>0010.16
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> 
{{< /term >}}

Let's convert the HEX bytes into a decimal number for easier calculations.
- ```= 0xaa02``` - find the decimal equivalent of 0xaa02 (43522).

> %RH= ((125 \* value)/65536)-6  
 %RH= ((125 \* 43522)/65536)-6  
 %RH= 77.01%

Now we can calculate humidity using the formula above. The humidity is 77% here in the office, what did you get?

## Measure temperature

![](/images/docs/demo/si7021-datasheet-readtemp.png)

We could use the *Measure Temperature, No Hold Master* command (0xf3) to trigger a new temperature measurement, which will include an additional 10.8ms delay. 

However, each humidity measurement also triggers a temperature measurement. The *Read Temperature from Previous Humidity Measurement* command (0xe0) reads the temperature from the last humidity measurement.

1. **S** - Begin with an I2C START bit
2. **SA + W** - Send the SI7021 write address (0x80)
3. ```0xe0``` - Send the read temperature from previous humidity measurement command
4. **Sr** - Send an I2C repeated START bit
5. **SA + R** - Send the SI7021 read address (0x81)
6. **MS/LS bytes** - Read the two byte temperature measurement
7. **P** - End with an I2C STOP bit

{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> [0x80 0xe0 [ 0x81 r:2]

I2C STOP
{{< /term >}}

Let's read the temperature from the last humidity measurement.

- ```[``` - I2C START bit
- ```0x80``` - SI7021 write address
- ```0xe0``` - Read temperature from previous humidity measurement command
- ```[``` - I2C repeated START bit
- ```0x81``` - SI7021 read address
- ```r:2``` - Read two bytes of data (the temperature measurement)
- ```]``` - I2C STOP bit

### Convert to temperature

{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> = 0x5ed4
 =0x<span style="color:#53a6e6">5E</span>D4.16 =24276.16 =0b<span style="color:#53a6e6">0101</span>1110<span style="color:#53a6e6">1101</span>0100.16
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> 
{{< /term >}}

Convert the HEX bytes into a decimal number with the ```=``` convert command. 
- ```= 0x5ed4``` - find the decimal equivalent of 0x5ed4 (24276).

> Temp C = ((175.72 \* value)/65536)-46.85  
Temp C = ((175.72 \* 24276)/65536)-46.85  
Temp C = 18.24 C

Now we can calculate the temperature using the formula above. The temperature is 18.24C.

## ```si7021``` command

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/si7021-command.html" >}}

```si7021``` command reads the SI7021, HTU21, SHT21 or HDC1080 temperature and humidity sensor. It returns the humidity, temperature and serial number in a single command.
