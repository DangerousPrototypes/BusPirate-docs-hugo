## Setup

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-setup.html" >}}

TSL2561 is an I2C device, so we need to set the Bus Pirate to I2C mode.

- ```m i2c``` - set the Bus Pirate to I2C [mode]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#m-set-bus-mode" >}}), or just hit ```m``` to select from the menu.
- ```400``` - set the I2C bus speed to 400kHz.
- ```1``` - disable clock stretching.

### Power supply
![](/images/docs/demo/tsl2561-datasheet-supply.png)

According to the datasheet, the TSL2561 requires a 2.7-3.6 volt power supply. 

Image source: [datasheet](https://look.ams-osram.com/m/6ecb086edd840d9f/original/TSL2561-DS000110.pdf).

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-power.html" >}}

Letâ€™s set the Bus Pirate to power the chip at 3.3volts, a very common voltage for modern I2C devices.
- ```W 3.3``` - enable the [onboard power supply]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#ww-power-supply-offon">}}) at 3.3volts.

### Pull-up resistors

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-pullup.html" >}}

I2C is an open collector output bus, the Bus Pirate and the TSL2561 can only pull the line low to 0 (ground). A pull-up resistor is needed to pull the line high to 1 (3.3 volts). The Bus Pirate has built-in pull-up resistors that can be enabled with the ```P``` command.
- ```P``` - Enable the [onboard pull-up resistors]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors">}}).

{{% alert context="warning" %}} 
Be sure to enable the pull-up resistors. Without them the clock and data line will never go high and you'll read only 0s.
{{% /alert %}}

## I2C address scan

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-scan.html" >}}

We need the correct I2C address to talk to the sensor. We could look in the datasheet, or we can run the handy [I2C address scanner]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#scan-i2c-address-search">}}).
- ```scan``` - Scan the I2C bus for devices

The scanner found an I2C device at address 0x39 (0x72 write, 0x73 read).

|ADDR SEL (Pin 2)|Address|
|---|---|
|GND|0101001x|
|Float|0111001x|
|VDD|01001001x|

Pin 2 (ADDR SEL) determines the I2C address of the TL2561. The default address is 0x39 (111001).  The address can be changed by connecting the ADDR SEL pin to VDD or GND. 

{{% alert context="info" %}} 
If the scanner doesn't find the device, ensure the power supply is enabled ```W 3.3``` and the pull-up resistors are enabled ```P```.

## Register map

| Address | Name | Function |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| --      | COMMAND       | Points to the register to read and write (0x00-0x0F) |
| 0x00     | CONTROL       | Control options |
| 0x01	 | TIMING        | Gain and integration time |
| 0x0A      | ID            | Part number and revision |
| 0x0C      | DATA0LOW      | Low byte of ADC channel 0 |
| 0x0D      | DATA0HIGH     | High byte of ADC channel 0 |
| 0x0E      | DATA1LOW      | Low byte of ADC channel 1 |
| 0x0F      | DATA1HIGH     | High byte of ADC channel 1 |

This is a partial register map showing the addresses we'll need to configure and control the TSL2561. 

| bit 7 | bit 6 | bit 5 | bit 4 | bit 3 | bit 2 | bit 1 | bit 0 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| CMD |CLEAR | WORD|BLOCK| ADDR[3]| ADDR[2]| ADDR[1]| ADDR[0]|

The address written to the command register points to the register for the next read/write. 
- The command register is accessed by setting bit 7 (CMD) of the command to 1.
- Because bit 7 controls access to the command register, bit 7 is always 0 for any other commands written to other registers.
- The lower four bits of the command register are the address of the register to read or write.
- For the sake of brevity, CLEAR and WORD are set to 1, and BLOCK is set to 0.

## Start device

| bit 7 | bit 6 | bit 5 | bit 4 | bit 3 | bit 2 | bit 1 | bit 0 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|Power1|Power0|

TSL2561 starts in power down mode. To start the device, write 0x03 (0b11) to the control register.

### Select CONTROL register

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-select-control-register.html" >}}

First, we need to write the address we wish to access to the command register. 

- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110010``` I2C write address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```0b11100000``` Write command register. Bit 7 set to 1, control register address (0x00/0b000) set in bits 3:0
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

### Start command

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-start-command.html" >}}

Next, we write 0x03 to the control register to start the device. The control register is already selected, so we only need to write the value 0x03. 

- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110010``` I2C write address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```3``` Write 0x03 to the control register
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

### Confirm start

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-confirm-start.html" >}}

Finally, we read the control register to confirm the device is running. The control register is already selected, so we only need to read the value.

- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110011``` I2C read address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```r``` Read the control register
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

The control register value is 0x33, the lower 2 bits are high (0x03) indicating the device is running.

## Configure gain and integration time

| bit 7 | bit 6 | bit 5 | bit 4 | bit 3 | bit 2 | bit 1 | bit 0 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| -- 	| -- 	| -- 	| GAIN  |	 -- |  --	| INTEG1 | INTEG0 |

The timing register configures the gain and integration time.
- Gain is 1x (0) or 16x (1). 16x gain helps measure in very low light levels. The default is 1x (0).
- Integration time (INTEG1:0) sets how long the sensor collects light measurements. 13.7ms (00), 101ms (01), 402ms (10). Shorter integration times help measure in very high light levels. The default is 402ms (10).

{{% alert context="info" %}}
We're going to use the default values. You can skip the configuration step if you like.
{{% /alert %}}

### Select TIMING register

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-select-timing-register.html" >}} 

Like the control register, first we set the command register to point at the timing register (0x01). 
- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110010``` I2C write address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```0b11100001``` Write command register. Bit 7 set to 1, timing register address (0x01/0b001) set in bits 3:0
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

### Write TIMING register

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-write-timing.html" >}}

Now configure the gain and integration time. Gain (bit 4): set to 0 (1x). Integration time (bits 1:0): set to 10 (402ms).

- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110010``` I2C write address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```0b00000010``` Write timing register. Bit 7 set to 0, gain (bit 4) set to 0, integration time (bits 1:0) set to 10
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

## Measure light

Once started the TSL2561 takes continuous light measurements with an ADC and stores them in the DATA0 and DATA1 registers. 

TSL2561 has two light sensors. One measures all light, the other measures infrared light only. The infrared value is used to compensate for light that isn't visible to the human eye. 

### Select DATA0LOW register

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-select-data0low.html" >}}

First, use the command register to select the DATA0LOW register (0x0C/0b1100) with bit 7 set to 1.
- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110010``` I2C write address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```0b11101100``` Write command register. Bit 7 set to 1, DATA0LOW register address (0x0C/0b1100) in bits 3:0
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

### Read DATA registers
{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> [0b01110011 r:4]

I2C START
<span style="color:#bfa530">TX:</span> 0b<span style="color:#53a6e6">0111</span>0011 ACK

I2C STOP
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> 
{{< /term >}}

We've arrived! It's time to read out the light sensor measurements. Each sensor measurement has a low and high byte, so we'll need to read 4 bytes (2 sensors, 2 bytes each).

- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110011``` I2C read address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```r:4``` Read 4 bytes
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

The data is read low byte first, followed by the high byte. Here, the measurements are 0x0043 and 0x000C.

### Convert to LUX

{{< term "Bus Pirate [/dev/ttyS0]" >}}
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> = 0x0043
 =0x43 =67 =0b01000011= 'C'
<span style="color:#96cb59">I2C></span> 
{{< /term >}}

- Use the [```=``` convert number format command]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#x-convert-to-hexdecbin-number-format" >}}) to find the decimal equivalent of 0x0043 = 67 (channel 0) and 0x0000C = 12 (channel 1) for easier calculation.

$$\text{ratio} = \frac{\text{chan1}}{\text{chan0}}$$
$$\text{ratio} = \frac{12}{67}$$
$$ \text{ratio} = 0.1791044776 $$

LUX is calculated by finding the ratio of the two channels, then using the ratio to select the correct formula.

| Ratio Range | Calculation |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| \<= 0.125    | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0.0304 - 0.0272*(ratio) |
| \<= 0.250    | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0.0325 - 0.0440*(ratio) |
| \<= 0.375    | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0.0351 - 0.0544*(ratio) |
| \<= 0.50     | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0.0381 - 0.0624*(ratio) |
| \<= 0.61     | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0.0224 - 0.031*(ratio) |
| \<= 0.80     | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0.0128 - 0.0153*(ratio) |
| \<= 1.30     | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0.00146 - 0.00112*(ratio) |
| > 1.30      | Lux/(Chan0\*16) = 0 |

Our ratio is greater than 0.125 and less than 0.250, so we'll use the second formula.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
By default the TSL2561 gain is set to 1. For this calculation we need to multiply the channel0 value by 16 to compensate for the gain. If the gain is set to 16, the channel0 value is multiplied by 1.
{{% /alert %}}


$$\text{lux} = \text{lux}/(\text{chan0}\times16) = 0.0325 - 0.0440 \times \text{ratio}$$
$$\text{lux}/(67\times16) = 0.0325 - 0.0440 \times (0.1791044776)$$
$$\text{lux}/1072 = 0.0325 - 0.0078801987$$
$$\text{lux}/1072 = 0.0246198013$$
$$\text{lux} = 0.0246198013 \times 1072$$
$$\text{lux} = 26.38$$

The compensated LUX value is 26.38.

There's lots of other goodies in the TSL2561. High and low levels of light can trigger an interrupt on the INT pin. Gain and sensing time (integration time) can be configured to get accurate readings in different light levels. This walk through gets you started, but there's lots more to explore in the datasheet.

## Read version

The ID register contains the part number and revision of the TSL2561.

### Select ID register

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-select-id-register.html" >}}

First, use the command register to select the ID register (0x0A/0b1010) with bit 7 set to 1.
- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110010``` I2C write address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```0b11101010``` Write command register. Bit 7 set to 1, ID register address (0x0A/0b1010) in bits 3:0
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

### Read ID register

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-read-id-register.html" >}}

Now read back the device ID and revision.
- ```[``` Begin with an I2C START
- ```0b01110011``` I2C read address for the TSL2651 (ADDR pin floating)
- ```r``` Read the ID register
- ```]``` End with an I2C STOP

The value is 0x50, which is 0b01010000. 
- The part number is the upper four bits: 0b0101 (5)
- The revision is the lower four bits: 0b0000 (0)

## ```tsl2561``` command

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/tsl2561-command.html" >}}

Can't get it to work? Need a sanity check? The ```tsl2561``` command in I2C mode configures the sensor, takes a measurement and converts the result to LUX.
