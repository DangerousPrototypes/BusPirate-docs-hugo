SLE4442 is a smart chip card with 256 bytes of memory and a write protect "passcode" feature. These have been around for quite some time, and were commonly used as stored value cards for copy machines and laundry machines. A three byte passcode protects the card from unauthorized writes. 

After three incorrect passcode attempts the card is permanently locked to prevent brute force guessing the code. Data can be read without a passcode, the code is only necessary to write to the card (e.g. add more money for copy or laundry machines).

This insecure system should be avoided in new designs. Anyone with access to the machine that updates the card value can use a logic analyzer to capture the passcode. The passcode is sent in the clear, and can be easily captured and replayed.

## Connections

![](/images/docs/demo/ic-card-pinout.png)

Common IC cards usually follow the [ISO 7816-3 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7816) and have the same pinout and contact shape. [Image source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SmartCardPinout.svg).

|Bus Pirate|SLE4442|Description|
|-|-|-|
|IO0/SDA|C7 - I/O|Bidirectional data|
|IO1/SCL|C3 - CLK|Clock|
|IO2/RST|C2 - RST|Reset|
|Vout|C1 - VCC|5volt power supply|
|GND|C5 - GND|Ground|

Connect the Bus Pirate to the smart card as shown in the table above. 

### Card Identification

![](/images/docs/demo/sle4442-24c02.jpg)

The card on the left with the smaller 6 pin contact area is a SLE4442. The card on the right with the larger 8 pin contact area is a 24C02 EEPROM card. 

### Smart IC Card and SIM card adapter

![](/images/docs/fw/sim-iccard-all.jpg)

It's possible to gently solder wires onto each pad of the chip, but a KF-011C (or similar) smart card socket is useful if you don't want to destroy the card.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
A [smart IC card and SIM card adapter]({{< relref "/docs/overview/sim-iccard-adapter" >}}) is available for Bus Pirate 5 with the correct connections already set. The adapter accepts most ISO 7816-3 smart cards and mini/micro/nano SIM cards.

## Setup

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-setup.html" >}}

Bus Pirate [2-WIRE mode]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#2-wire" >}}) has a bi-directional data line and a clock line, it will play well with the SLE4442. SLE4442 (clones) generally have a maximum speed of 50kHz, but some are much happier at lower speeds so let's use 20kHz. 

- ```m 2wire``` - Select **2-WIRE** [mode]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#m-set-bus-mode" >}}).
- ```20``` - Configure 2-WIRE for **20kHz**

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-power.html" >}}

This is old tech - it needs a 5volt power supply.
- ``` W 5``` - Enable the [onboard power supply]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#ww-power-supply-offon">}}) at 5 volts

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-pullup.html" >}}

The bidirectional data line is an open collector bus, the Bus Pirate and the SLE4442 can only pull the line low to 0/ground. A pull-up resistor is needed to pull the line high to 1/5volts. The Bus Pirate has built-in pull-up resistors that can be enabled with the ```P``` command.
- ```P``` - Enable the [onboard pull-up resistors]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#pp-pull-up-resistors" >}}).

{{% alert context="warning" %}} 
Be sure to enable the pull-up resistors. The data line will never go high without them and you'll read only 0s.
{{% /alert %}}

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-lsb.html" >}}

SLE4442 commands and output are in the less-used Least Signification Bit (LSB) byte/word format. Enter L to set the Bus Pirate to LSB mode. 
- ```L``` - Set the [bit order]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#ll-set-msblsb-first">}}) to LSB first

{{% alert context="warning" %}} 
The SLE4442 uses Least Significant Bit first data format, but the Bus Pirate defaults to Most Significant Bit first. Be sure to set the bit order to LSB first with the ```L``` command.

## Answer To Reset (ATR)

![](/images/docs/demo/sle4442-datasheet-atr.png)

[Answer To Reset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card_application_protocol_data_unit) (ATR) is a command sequence sent to reset and initialize the SLE4442. This diagram on page 10 of the [datasheet](https://www.digikey.com.au/htmldatasheets/production/433077/0/0/1/sle-4442-m3-2.html) shows the ATR sequence.

- After enabling power (VCC), the reset line (RST) low should start low.
- RST is set to high
- A single clock tick on the CLK line
- RST is set to low
- Provide 32 more clock ticks and read the 4 byte (32 bit) response on the IO line

The card returns 4 bytes that can be used to identify the card type and capabilities.

Let's send the ATR command via the Bus Pirate.


- ```}``` - RST/[reset line low]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#bus-commands-6">}}) to start
- ```{``` - RST high to begin the ATR 
- ```^``` - One [clock tick]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#-clock-pin-tick-limited">}}) on the CLK/clock line 
- ```}``` - RST low completes the reset sequence
- ```r:4``` - [Read]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#r-read-byte">}}) the four byte 'answer' to the reset sequence

![](/images/docs/demo/atr-sle4442.png)

In the logic analyzer capture above, flag 0 marks after RESET is high and just before the single clock tick. RESET then goes low, and at flag 1 we clock out four bytes of data from the card on DIO.

![](/images/docs/demo/sle4442-datasheet-atr-table.png)

The correct reply for the SLE4442 is 0xa2 0x13 0x10 0x91. This indicates the card is an SLE44xx series card, with 256 data units of 8 bits each (256 bytes). Wikipedia has a [table that explains the meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card_application_protocol_data_unit) of each field in the ATR response, or see page 25 of the datasheet.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
If the response is 0x45 0xC8 0x08 0x89, then the bitorder is incorrect. The Bus Pirate is in MSB mode, but the SLE4442 uses LSB mode. Use the ```L``` command to set the Bus Pirate to LSB mode.

The [sle4442]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#sle4442" >}}) command automates the ATR and parses the output. 

## Read card memory

![](/images/docs/demo/sle4442-datasheet-protocol.png)

Now that the card is reset, we can interface it with a 2 wire protocol that has I2C-like START and STOP bits. Page 14 of the datasheet shows the protocol: each 3 byte command begins with a START bit and ends with a STOP bit. The Bus Pirate 2-WIRE mode sends [START and STOP bits]({{< relref "/docs/command-reference/#bus-commands-6" >}}) using the ```[```/```]``` commands.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Unlike I2C, the SLE4442 protocol does not use ACK/NACK bits. 
{{% /alert %}}

![](/images/docs/demo/sle4442-datasheet-readmem.png)

Main memory is read with the 0x30 command. The next byte is the address to start reading from (0-255), and the last byte doesn't matter for this command. The entire 256 byte contents of the card must be read before the card will accept another command.

<span style="color:#96cb59">2WIRE></span> 
{{< /term >}}

Let's put that all together. Begin the command with a START bit, then send the command, address and dummy bytes, end with a STOP bit. Finally, read all 256 bytes from the card.

- ```[``` - I2C style START bit
- ```0x30``` - Read memory command 
- ```0x00``` - Start reading from address 0x00
- ```0x00``` - Dummy byte, no function in SLE4442
- ```]``` - I2C style STOP bit
- ```r:256``` - Read 256 bytes

The first 32 bytes or so include the ATR data and some other information about the card (depending on manufacturer). On a new card the rest of the memory will be 0xFF.

## Unlock write access

The SLE4442 has a write protect feature that requires a 3 byte passcode to write to the card. After three incorrect passcode attempts the card is permanently locked to prevent brute force guessing of the code.

### Read security memory

| Command | Control | Address | Data | Read | Remark |
|---------|---------|---------|------|--------|-|
| Read Security Memory | 31H | No effect | No effect| 4 bytes | Check Error Counter (byte 1) |

A four byte security memory area contains the remaining unlock attempts, and the three byte passcode. The three passcode bytes will always read 0x00 when the card is locked. Read the security memory using the 0x31 command.

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-readsec.html" >}}

The command to read the security memory is similar to the command to read the main memory, but with a different command byte. The command is:

- ```[``` - I2C style START bit
- ```0x31``` - Read security memory command
- ```0x00``` - Start reading from address 0x00
- ```0x00``` - Dummy byte, no function in SLE4442
- ```]``` - I2C style STOP bit
- ```r:4``` - Read 4 bytes

The first byte of the response (0x07) indicates the number of unlock attempts that remain. The remaining bytes are the passcode, which will always be 0x00 if the card is locked. 

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-convert-error-counter.html" >}}

Converting 0x07 to binary (0b111) indicates that 3 attempts remain on this card. 

### Send passcode

| Command | Control | Address | Data | Remark |
|---------|---------|---------|------|--------|
| Compare Verification Data | 33H | 01H-03H | Passcode bytes 1-3 | Send >256 clock ticks for processing|
| Update Security Memory | 39H | 00H | Error Counter | Write free bit in Error Counter: 0000 0ddd binary |

Unlocking the card is a multiple step process:

- Choose a remaining passcode attempt bit using the ```0x39``` command
- Write each byte of the passcode using the ```0x33``` command
- Reset the remaining passcode attempts using the ```0x39``` command
- Read the security memory again to verify the passcode was accepted

#### Choose a remaining passcode attempt bit

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-choose-attempt.html" >}}

The first byte in the security memory is 0x07 (0b111). This means that three passcode attempts remain. We need to choose a '1' bit to use for the next passcode attempt. If we enter the wrong passcode, this bit will be set to 0 and two attempts will remain.

- ```[``` - I2C style START bit
- ```0x39``` - Update security memory command
- ```0x00``` - Security memory address to write
- ```0b110``` - Choose a remaining passcode attempt bit, we're using bit 0 (0b110), but any bit with a '1' will work (0b011, 0b101)
- ```]``` - I2C style STOP bit
- ```^:1000``` - Send 1000 clock ticks to complete the command

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Security commands require ~256 clock ticks to complete at 50kHz. We use ```^:1000``` to send 1000 clock ticks to ensure the command is completed at our lower speed of 20kHz.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Write passcode bytes

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-write-passcode-default.html" >}}

The passcode is written to the security memory in three steps. Each byte is written with the ```0x33``` command to addresses 0x01, 0x02, and 0x03. The default passcode is generally 0xff 0xff 0xff for new SLE4442 cards.

- ```[0x33 0x01 0xff] ^:1000``` - Write 0xff to security memory address 0x01
- ```[0x33 0x02 0xff] ^:1000``` - Write 0xff to security memory address 0x02
- ```[0x33 0x03 0xff] ^:1000``` - Write 0xff to security memory address 0x03

{{% alert context="info" %}} 
The default passcode is generally 0xff 0xff 0xff for new SLE4442 cards.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Reset passcode attempts

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-readsec-reset-attempts.html" >}}

The remaining passcode attempts are reset to 0x07 (0b111) after the passcode is accepted. This is done with the ```0x39``` command to address 0x00 with the data 0xff.
- ```[0x39 0x00 0xff] ^:1000``` - Reset the remaining passcode attempts to 0x07

#### Verify card is unlocked

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-verify-unlock.html" >}}

If the card was successfully unlocked, the remaining passcode attempts will be reset to 0x07 (0b111). We can verify this by reading the security memory again.
- ```[0x31 0x00 0x00] r:4``` - Read the security memory   

The remaining passcode attempts are 0x07 (0b111), meaning the card is unlocked. We can now see that the passcode bytes are 0xff 0xff 0xff.

{{% alert context="info" %}}
If the passcode was incorrect, the passcode attempt bit will be set to 0 and two attempts will remain. Use a different bit for the next passcode attempt - we used 0b110 (bit 0) for the first attempt, so we could use 0b101 (bit 1) for the next attempt.

## Write card memory

| Command | Control | Address | Data | 
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| UPDATE MAIN MEMORY | B7...B0 | A7…A0 | D7…D0 |
| Hexadecimal | 38H | 00H…FFH | Input data | 

The SLE4442 has 256 bytes of memory that can be written with the ```0x38``` command. Only one byte of data can be written per command at the location indicated by the address byte. 

{{% alert context="info" %}}
It's best to avoid writing to the first 32 bytes of memory, as this area contains the ATR data and other information about the card. Overwriting the ATR data can cause the card to stop working.
{{% /alert %}}

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-write-byte.html" >}}

Let's write 0x55 to address 255 (0xff) in the main memory. 
- ```[``` - I2C style START bit
- ```0x38``` - Write memory command
- ```255``` - Write at address 255 (0xff)
- ```0x55``` - Write 0x55 to address 255
- ```]``` - I2C style STOP bit
- ```^:1000``` - Send 1000 clock ticks to complete the command

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
Card must be unlocked or writes will fail.

Now, let's verify that the data was written correctly by reading the memory again.
- ```[0x30 0 0] r:256``` - Read 256 bytes

The last byte of the memory is now 0x55, the write was successful. 

## Change passcode

| Command | Control | Address | Data |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| UPDATE SECURITY MEMORY | B7...B0 | A7…A0 | D7…D0 | |
| Hexadecimal | 39H | 00H…03H | Input data | |

For our final act, let's update the passcode so intrepid hackers can't break in using the default. 

The new passcode is written to the security memory in three steps. Each byte is written with the ```0x39``` command to addresses 0x01, 0x02, and 0x03.

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-psc-set.html" >}}

Let's set the passcode to 0x12 0x34 0x56.

- ```[0x39 0x01 0x12] ^:1000``` - Write 0x12 to security memory address 0x01
- ```[0x39 0x02 0x34] ^:1000``` - Write 0x34 to security memory address 0x02
- ```[0x39 0x03 0x56] ^:1000``` - Write 0x56 to security memory address 0x03

### Verify passcode update

{{< termfile source="static/snippets/sle4442-psc-set-verify.html" >}}

The passcode is now 0x12 0x34 0x56. Let's verify the passcode was updated by reading the security memory again.

- ```[0x31 0x00 0x00] r:4``` - Read the security memory

Three passcode attempts remain (0x07), and the passcode is now 0x12 0x34 0x56.

## Variants

SLE4428 is similar to the SLE4442, but with a few notable differences. SLE4428 is a 1024 byte EEPROM card, and it does not have the passcode write protection feature of the SLE4442. If you're looking for a bigger card for a new project, check out [24Cxx EEPROM cards]({{< relref "/docs/devices/24c02" >}}). 24Cxx cards come in larger sizes up to 64K, and have a standard I2C interface.


If you can't help but deal with an SLE4428 card, it should work similar to the SLE4442 with a 2 byte address field.
